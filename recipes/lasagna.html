    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering flat, wide pasta sheets with rich meat or vegetable sauce, creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese, and grated cheese like mozzarella or parmesan. It's baked until bubbly and golden, resulting in a hearty, comforting meal. Originating from Italy—particularly the Emilia-Romagna region—lasagna is loved worldwide and has many variations, including vegetarian, seafood, and white sauce versions.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lasagna noodles – flat, wide pasta sheets</li>
        <li>Ground meat – typically beef or a mix of beef and pork (can be replaced with vegetables for vegetarian versions)</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce – often made with crushed tomatoes, garlic, onions, and herbs</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Sauce:
Sauté chopped onions and garlic in olive oil, add ground meat (or vegetables), cook until browned, then mix in tomato sauce, salt, pepper, and herbs. Simmer for 15–20 minutes.

</li>
        <li>Layer the Lasagna:
In a baking dish, layer in this order: sauce → lasagna noodles → ricotta or béchamel → mozzarella. Repeat 2–3 times, ending with sauce and a generous sprinkle of mozzarella and parmesan on top</li>
        <li>Bake:
Cover with foil and bake at 180°C (350°F) for 25–30 minutes, then uncover and bake another 10–15 minutes until golden and bubbly. Let it rest 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
